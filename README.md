# Rust OPDS

A project for me to learn more about Rust.  It takes a directory of
comics and will serve an OPDS feed of them on port 3000.  Works much better if
the comics are tagged by something like [comictagger](https://github.com/davide-romanini/comictagger).

This is not intended to ever be a fully featured comic management or reading app.  It's intended to be
a low resource server to be used with a reader that supports OPDS.

It's in pre-alpha, not yet working state.  You can check out the TODO list if you want to follow along
with my work list or pop something into the issues.
