My TODOlist for beta (roughly in priorty order)

- serve OPDS feeds based on db
- serve comics based on OPDS feed
- track read status
- tests!!
- create auth / users
- track read status per person
- remove old paths (probably need a seperate binary since we don't want to wipe DB by mistake)
- transcode comics to webp (70 quality seems to be sweet spot)
