My TODOlist for beta (roughly in priorty order)

Functionality:
- store size and modtime
- import comicrack Db
- serve OPDS feeds based on db
- serve comics based on OPDS feed
- track read status
- create auth / users
- track read status per person
- remove old paths (probably need a seperate binary since we don't want to wipe DB by mistake)
- transcode comics to webp (70 quality seems to be sweet spot)


Cleanup type tasks
- tests!!
- use Default in DB
