My TODOlist for beta (roughly in priorty order)

Functionality:
- prune old paths (probably need a seperate binary since we don't want to wipe DB by mistake)

Post Beta:
- make DB and xml generation async (fast enough, and probably most use cases won't need high concurrency)
  - I think I can just wrap them in blocking futures
- transcode comics to webp (70 quality seems to be sweet spot)
- support streaming extension (http://vaemendis.net/opds-pse/)
- database migrations
- search
- basic admin page
- 7zip support
- path based OPDS feed
- pagination of feed
- option to add tag files when importing comicrack Db

Cleanup type tasks
- tests!!
- refactor DB (maybe make a query builder type thing)
