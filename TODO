My TODOlist for beta (roughly in priorty order)

Functionality:
- serve covers
  - store all file entries, will need this for streaming
- import comicrack Db (probably a seperate binary since we'll do it once)
  - option to update the tag files
- prune old paths (probably need a seperate binary since we don't want to wipe DB by mistake)


Post Beta:
- make DB and xml generation async (fast enough, and probably most use cases won't need high concurrency)
- transcode comics to webp (70 quality seems to be sweet spot)
- support streaming extension (http://vaemendis.net/opds-pse/)
- database migrations
- search
- basic admin page
- 7zip support
- path based OPDS feed

Cleanup type tasks
- tests!!
