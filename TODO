My TODOlist for beta (roughly in priorty order)

Functionality:
- serve OPDS feeds based on db
  * all
  - recent
  - unread
  - publisher/title
  - path
- serve comics 
- serve covers
- track read status
- create auth / users
- track read status per person
- store size and modtime
- make DB and xml generation async
- import comicrack Db (probably a seperate binary since we'll do it once)
  - option to update the tag files
- prune old paths (probably need a seperate binary since we don't want to wipe DB by mistake)
- transcode comics to webp (70 quality seems to be sweet spot)


Cleanup type tasks
- tests!!
- clippy
