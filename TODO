My TODOlist for beta (roughly in priorty order)

Functionality:
- create empty db
- serve OPDS feeds based on db
  * all
  * recent
  * unread
  - publisher/title
  - path
- serve covers
  - probably have to tag cover candidates during scan
- allow configuration
- store size and modtime
- make DB and xml generation async
- import comicrack Db (probably a seperate binary since we'll do it once)
  - option to update the tag files
- prune old paths (probably need a seperate binary since we don't want to wipe DB by mistake)
- transcode comics to webp (70 quality seems to be sweet spot)


Cleanup type tasks
- tests!!
- clippy
